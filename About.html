    <h2>Week 2:The Medium is the Message</h2>
    <p>
      The medium is the message by Marshall McLuhan is an interesting piece of
      work. This reading expands and tells us how a medium affects the message
      we try to convey. The passage talks about how the medium of a message
      becomes part of the message and so enhances the meaning that is brought
      across through the combination of the medium and the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of the medium and the ideas that the message holds is
      something powerful that can affect the way we think and feel about certain
      topics so I believe in this reading McLuhan tries to show us the
      importance of how a medium works together with its contents to produce
      something that could change and have social, political, and economic
      consequences. This message could also affect the way we think about the
      topics it addresses and so it can also affect the understanding of a
      society. The medium is what conveys a message and so it also allows
      certain people to receive this message through accessibility and interest.
      Due to the fact that in today’s society information is so readily
      available it is hard for people to see all the information available on
      media today this also means that not everyone will see the message one is
      trying to convey. This is shown in the many ways that people try to draw
      the attention of others to certain things this could be and advert that
      pops up when one is watching a video on YouTube or when ads pop up during
      browsing the internet and since a message is shown this way in some
      mediums people will trust the information more the others. An example of
      this is if an advertisement pops up on Television majority of people will
      immediately assume it’s real and due to the fact that a lot of people
      watch TV it has credibility whereas if the same add pops up while one is
      one a random website it has much less value due to internet scams and
      viruses.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that in this reading McLuhan is trying to show that the media
      has a lot of power and even more so when it uses certain mediums. He warns
      that the way we perceive and consume media will make us act a certain way
      and believe certain things whereas not all people consume the same media
      which means that there will be division between people in society as some
      many people will believe different things about the same topic depending
      on the media which they consume. Since a lot of people are used to
      consuming media, it also means that many people are not aware of the type
      of media they consume and so a lot of false information is taken I and
      this is used to control and manipulate the vast majority of people into
      believing and agreeing with certain ideals and information.
    </p>

    <p>
      McLuhan’s reading can also be applied to things like games where one will
      enjoy playing certain games on certain platforms more then they do on
      other platforms. An example of this is the game “genshin impact” that is
      available of mobile, PC and console. Due the game being available on these
      platforms the way you play them is different and personally I prefer
      playing is on console due the fact that it has a controller. For me the
      controller allows easier movement and attacking as well as dodging and it
      feels like I have more control over what I am doing in the game. This will
      apply to everyone that plays the game as people will like it on different
      mediums and they experience the game better on said mediums.
    </p>

    <p>this is what i took from the reading "The Medium is the Message.</p>

    <h2>Week 4 - What is a browser? How do they work?</h2>

    <p>
      According to Mozilla a web browser is something that that takes you
      anywhere on the internet. This means that it will take you to any
      available place on the internet such as websites and search engines. A web
      browser gets information from these parts on the internet and displays it
      on the device you are using. This information is sent using http
      (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) which is used to tell the device and browser
      how text, videos and other forms of media are transmitted on the internet.
      (Mozilla, n.d.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of web browsers include google chrome, internet explorer and
      opera. These browsers are used by devices to input information and search
      the internet for that information to display to the user. All browsers do
      not use and interpret information the same and so this means that on
      different browsers websites will look and function differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browsers use software called rendering engines to translate the data they
      receive from the internet into images and text. Hypertext Markup Language
      (HTML) is the language that the data is written in, and the rendering
      engines reads this code to provide us with the things we experience on the
      internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main job of browsers consists of DNS resolution, HTTP exchange,
      Rendering and repeat. DNs resolution is the process where one enters a
      URL, and the browser will know which server need to connect to. The
      browser talks to this server in order to get and IP address so that the
      browser can find what the URL wants to display.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTTP exchange happens when our browser communicates with servers in order
      to get the information we are looking for. Is an exchange of a request
      from out browser and a reply from the server where we want the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rendering is the process using the data we receive to render the text
      style images and visuals we see on whatever website we are looking for.
      Its is the combination of Html, CSS and JavaScript that creates and
      interactable website for use to see on our devices. (freeCodeCamp, 2018)

    <h2>Week 6 – The uses of Metadata – what, why, how</h2>
    <p>
      Metadata is often referred to as data that describes other data, its known
      as structured reference data that helps to sort and find out about the
      information is describes. The word “Meta is a prefix that basically means
      “and underlying definition or description” which mean that metadata is
      information that tell us more about the data we are looking at. This can
      make it easier to find and use instances of data and to see where it was
      found and use. (Kranz, n.d.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do we use metadata? We use metadata because it helps to improve the
      data we are using. The metadata makes up for the mistakes people make as
      people often lose or misplace data, so metadata is way to find the data we
      were using, and it makes sure we preserve and can re-use this data in the
      future. It also helps to show the credibility of the data we are using by
      showing when it was created or edited, and it also shown who created or
      edited it. (UNC, n.d.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Metadata is created anytime a document is modified or even deleted this is
      used to prolong and find data wherever we need it, and it will always make
      sure that the data we are using comes from a source and we can identify
      where or who that source is. It is useful as it basically shows us the
      history of any data we use and can help us if we ever need to verify data
      or find this data to use. (Kranz, n.d.)
