    <h1>WEB DESIGN</h1>

    <h2>Style guide</h2>

    <p>
      For this website i decided to use a space theme as i thought it would be a
      cool theme to use through out the site i tried to incorporate all colors
      that would be seen in space but i decided to stick mostly with blue, black
      and white it was interesting process designing the site.

    <h2>Technical Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      personally the whole assignment ws not that bad i think ive gotten really
      use to coding and using the lecture as a guide helped me aloy in the
      coding of the website. I realised that im still use to styling in HTML
      like we use to do in school so it was a challange to remind myself that i
      had to make a Css folder in order to do this. The use of images are really
      cool and i found that the best method for myself was to use and image in
      the image folder and it is more secure and i am less likly to make
      mistakes as the image is thier for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also realise that black text was goning to be unseen with my background
      so i made the text white and tried to give the text a blury background so
      it stood out and was easily readable by the audience. i also struggled
      with the back ground image as i had alot of images for the portfolio
      section and it extended really far down but the other sections didnt have
      as much length so i made the background long for all sections so it didnt
      look as wierd.
    </p>

    <h2>Creative Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      i found being creative to be really hard and so i just decided to go with
      a design or concept that i like. i basically first chose a theme and then
      just based everything off of that theme as it seemed llike the best option
      for myself. i realised that when it comes to color and creativity i
      struggle alot but when except when it comes to stuff like drawing figures,
      weapons and people as they are basically just shapes without color. i
      tried to stick to a matching range of color so i chose blue, black and
      white and tried to use it wherever i needed.
