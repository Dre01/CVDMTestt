    <h1>Portfolio</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Calvin, i am 20 years old and i study BA Digital Arts at The
      University of Witwatersrand. I am currently in my 3rd year and i have
      taken th subject Interactive Media and Game Design.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interests include drawing illustrations, coding, playing games and
      discovering more about the digital world. My dream is to oneday become a
      game designer and own my own studio where we will be making AAA games. i
      want to great the best games and compete in the world with my games and i
      want them to be interesting and difeerent. i would like to be able to say
      that i have designed this game from nothing but my own ideas or atleast
      concepts. i know it would take alot to do it on my own but i would like to
      atleast be the person that puts majority of the work and concepts in the
      game so that i can call it my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are some of the illustrations that i have made in order to improve
      my ability in drawing.
